# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project is an analysis of kickstarter data.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to show how different kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The Outcomes based on Launch Date shows some important findings. Firstly, when looking at ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png], the line graph shows that the outcomes of theater kickstarters that launched in the months of May and June, despite the year, had a higher number of successful kickstarters compared to those with launch dates in other months, especially December. Another conclusion from this analysis is that the number of failed kickstarters remains relatively stable and has not ever dropped down below 31 or risen to over 52 per month. Overall, the number of successful theater kickstarters has always been greater than the number of failed and canceled theater kickstarters. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The Outcomes based on Goals line graph clearly shows that kickstarters with goals that are $45,000 or more tend to fail at least 88 percent of the time, with those in the $45,000 to $49,000 goal range failing 100 percent of the time. It would be wise if setting up a new kickstarter for plays, not to set the goal too high. The goal range with the highest success rate relative to fail rate is $1000 to $4999.  

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
While this dataset highlights interesting facts about theater kickstarters, this dataset has its limitations. A helpful sub level category of play genre or type, such as comedy or drama, could help reveal trends about the types of plays that have successful kickstarters. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
It would be useful to create other tables and graphs with this dataset. One example is a table and graph to show the differences in deadlines to see if the duration of the kickstarter affects the success rate.
